# Research about OBJECTS

I been wondering  how do **rails** wield with objects.

* Do controller object created on every request?

* Do it created on every request in different environments?

And I created this tiny project. So what do I got.

* On **develoment** Rails.env controller object creates on every request.

* On **development** env class variables exists all time the servers works.

* the same with **production** env
